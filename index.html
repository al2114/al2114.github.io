			</div>
			<div class="col-md-7 about-text">
				<p class="faded">I am an engineering student and avid techie. Born in Montreal, Canada, I grew up with a very international background having also lived in the San Francisco Bay Area and Beijing before moving to London to study at Imperial College London. With this, I am lucky to be able to have a network which spans the globe.</p>
				<p class="faded">I am deeply passionate about everything that’s happening in the tech world! I am often found lost in discussion talking to my peers and colleagues about the impact of technology, what the future may look like, and the socialogical implications of technology. I am especially interested in the human-centric side of technology and its sociological effects.</p>
				<p class="faded">Throughout my studies, I always strive to develop the skills required for the world of tomorrow, taking interest in courses such as <strong>machine learning, computer vision &amp pattern recognition, user-centered information systems, and human-centered robotics</strong>. Through the work I do in my spare time, I also gain a significant amount of skills and experience that often cannot be found in the classroom; some of these include - <strong>graphic design, hacking electronics/hardware, building small software tools for productivity, and rapid prototyping &amp design</strong></p>
				<p class="faded">As an engineer, the phrase “knowledge is power” holds very true to my belief, as with knowledge, we are truly empowered by transforming abstract concepts and ideas into tangible reality. I believe that the endeavour of human ingenuity is something that holds true beauty, and aim to make use of my knowledge and experience to take part in shaping our fascinating world.</p>

							<h5>Software Engineer Intern</h5>
							<p>
								In the most recent summer period, I had been interning as a Software Engineer at CloudMinds, a startup innovating in the field of cloud intelligence and robotics.
							</p>
							<p>
								During my internship, I had worked as part of the virutalisation working on the dualOS product of the company's flagship DATA cloud intelligent mobile terminal, which enabled the device to run multiple isolated Android systems through hardware virutalisation. 
							</p>
							<p>
								I was able to contribute to various system-level services and applications throughout the duration of my internship including devleopment of a system debug toolset, and designing the operating system switch interface. Out of my contribtuions, my most significant would involve leading the development of the over-the-air (OTA) software update feature for the dualOS product, of which, I had to coordinate a team of engineers across departments (including cloud, platform, UI, and testing) to ensure the feature was developed to the product requirements and ready for product release. 
							</p>


					<!-- 		<p>I have just recently started my summer internship at CloudMinds, a startup working on cloud intelligence and robotics.</p>
							<p>I am working with the virtualisation team whose focus is on cloud-based virutalization of mobile and robotic operating systems.</p>

							<h5>Embedded Software Engineer Intern</h5>
							<p>Borqs is a leading IoT products and solutions with a focus on Android operating system based in Beijing.</p>
							<p>As part of a 3 month summer internship, I worked with the In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI) team in helping to implement a Linux driver for a new Atmel touchpanel component. The driver was integrated into Borqs' Android IVI system running on Freescale's i.MX6 SoC. Specific tasks I worked on include mapping and synchronizing the touch coordinate to the OS coordinate system, and integrating the TP signals to system events to provide multi-touch and gesture functionality to the IVI system.</p>
							<p>This was a great learning experience, getting to understand more about programming for the Linux kernel, and also getting a glimpse more at how real products are brought to production.</p>

						This is my most recent and on-going personal projects aiming to create a voice-controlled personal assitant robotic lamp running on a RaspberryPi. The project was very much inspired by a TED Talk given by Guy Hoffman, then a researcher from the MIT Media Labs. The primary motivation behind this project is to explore different aspects of human-robot interaction, and how robots may be seemlessly integrated into the human environment. Using a lamp as an interactive medium is very effective at achieving this, as not only is it both able to fit naturally in the household environment, but also has a wide range of motion to be able to perform relatively expressive movements. Additionally, I am also interested in seeing how non-verbal communication can be used to enhance interactivity when it comes to communicating with artificial agents. The project is still work-in-progress. I have currently motorised parts of the lamp and developed a primitive reverse kinematic model which allows for the RaspberryPi to interface with the motor controller to issue basic smooth movement, as well as a very basic voice-controlled agent. Future work include refining the voice agent, implementing some useful functionality, and computer vision for facial and gesture tracking.

							This was a project developed in close collaboration with Microsoft as part of my third year group project course. The project was built on top of the Smart Bike Project, an initiative proposed by Microsoft to help Mark Pollock, a blind and paralegic athelete, extend the IoT capabilities of his hand-powered bike and provide assistive technologies to support his physical training. After speaking with Mark Pollock and listening to his experiences as an individual with disabilities, our project team quickly realised that a major annoyance he faced in his setup is the effort required by him to use fitness app on his phone used to interface with his bike sensors. This problem in fact outlines a larger problem regarding how blind users interact with smartphones applications; a problem inherent in designing for the touchscreen. As such, our team proposed a new design model for inclusive mobile applicaiton design which, generally speaking, involves hybrid gesture-voice controlled input, a simplified and more intuitive navigational structure, and contextual support to improve user experience. We built a fitness app based on this new porposed model as an alternative to Mark's original setup, which significantly reduced the complexity involved in setup, and provided extra functionality lost in translation from traditional methods. During this project, I coordinated the project group, and was responsible for developing the system architecture and software design. Our team's solution was very well received by both Mark, and the Microsoft team, and has generated a lot of interest by Microsoft's Research division to investigate how this can be further developed and integrated for use by the larger disability community.

							I participated in this year's Eurobot competition as a member of the Imperial College Robotic Society team. Eurobot is an annual competition where teams from universities across Europe build robots to compete autonomously against each other by completing tasks and scoring points in a time-limited arena environment. This year, the competition's theme was Moon Village, and the primary task involved gathering and collecting various "lunar objects" within the provided time limit. We decided to challenge ourselves by creating an omnidirectional robot using three omni wheels. The robot utilises a combination of RaspberryPis, Arduinos, and mbeds to drive its various functions including motor control, arm control, localisation, path planning and collision detection. Our robot uses odometry data, computer vision triangulation (using chilitag beacons) and kalman filtering to provide localisation information, which it makes use of to navigate throughout the arena. Utilising a three-wheel omnidirectional drive proved to be challenging, and even after a lot of effort put into tuning motor controllers, still resulted in suboptimal motion when compared to many of the other robots. Nonetheless, using three-wheeled omnidirectional drive had never been seen before on the competition, and our implementation garnered quite a decent amount of interest during the event.

							The Plantarium Nova is a temperature and humidity controlled capsule designed for home plant growing and monitoring developed by Team Icarus. The device runs on a ESP8266 WiFi module and interfaces with a series of sensors including LED lights, a temperature sensor, a humidity sensor, a humidifier, and a temperature regulator. This allows for the device to create a closed loop control system to regulate the capsule and provide the optimal climate profile for a given plant. Additionally, the device connects to an MQTT broker which allows for it to communicate with our backend system, enabling IoT functionality. A front-end control panel interface was developed using the D3.js framework to graphically visualise the sensor readings in real time, with the side panel enabling users to create profiles for different temperature/humidity settings. I was primarily responsible for the development of the web control interface and backend system.

							Ephemeral is an app that a few friends and I had worked on during IC Hack 2017. It is a textmessaging platform trying to emulate the way individuals communicate in spoken conversation, where information is streamlined and words are temporary. As such, your message begins appearing on your correspondent's screen as soon as you begin your first keystroke, and subsequently the message will begin to disappear as soon as the full message has been delivered and read. The aim is to create a messaging platform that will allow for more genuine conversations to take place between individual, with the added benefit of privacy offered by typing your conversation (i.e. in public spaces). We also took this as a learning opportunity, and set ourselves the constraint of developing the entire platform using just Swift, utilising Perfect, a server-side Swift framework to develop our app's backend.

							As part of my first year project, I developed a realtime object detection implementation on an Altera Cyclone IV FPGA. The implementation was built using Catapult-C HLS, enabling hardware acceleration of a computationally expensive task. Computation involve performing convolution and colour space mapping to threshold out interested colour sections. As skin detection was a feature focused on in this implementation, we utilise chroma-difference to isolate regions of colours by mapping and thresholding in the YCrCb colour space. Users may utilise the cursor to focus on different parts of the image for the system to automatically calibrate thresholding parameters to perform detection of a specific colour profile (e.g. a person's face to detect skin). By paralelising and pipelining the various stages, the system can achieve near-realtime and high throughput result.
